# MyJupyterNotebookData
Very Simple and basic application for ML and python. In this repository whatever I have uploaded is developed in Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) with Python 3.X.
Very Simple applications I have uploaded because it becomes very easy to understand for all and one can easily get the point and can develop their own applications for ML.
